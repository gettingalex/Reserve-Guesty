# Availability and Reservation Tool based on Guesty

## About

This tool extracts the listing from Guesty and displays them in a dropdown menu with a datepicker, in order for the user to check the availability. If the unit is available for all the selected period, the users can then make a payment via Stripe. However, if the unit is not available for the entire selected period, a flash message will be returned under the availability form.

*Please note that the code to automatically post the new reservation to Guesty is not included.
